# Examples
This directory contains examples to help you learn how Cliphp works.  
During development, the system will search for scripts within this directory but once your script is packed this directory is ignored.  

Nevertheless, if it is bothering you, it can be safely deleted. :)

To get started run:
```
$ php src/index.php main
```

## Contribution
In an effort to expand the example list fell free to propose new scripts. I'll be more than happy to hear your suggestions. :)
